# m1-typecheck

The semantic-analysis layer of the MoTeC M1 (`.m1scr`) toolchain. Where `m1-core`
(syntax) and `m1-lint` (CST-only style rules) know nothing about what a name *is*,
`m1-typecheck` loads the project's **symbol model** and uses it to resolve
identifiers, type expressions, and emit type/naming diagnostics that are
impossible without that knowledge.

It is both a **library** (consumed by `m1-lsp` for hover/types and as a third
diagnostic source) and a **CLI**.

## Workspace layout

The M1 toolchain lives in **six separate repositories**. They are not published
to crates.io; instead each crate pins its upstreams as **versioned git-tag Cargo
dependencies** (e.g. `m1-core = { git = "…/m1-core.git", tag = "v0.3.1" }`), so
this crate **does** build from a standalone clone — Cargo fetches its upstreams
from their tagged releases. Checking the whole set out as siblings under one
parent directory is handy for cross-repo work, but is not required to build:

```
<parent>/
├── tree-sitter-m1/   # grammar (root)
├── m1-core/          # parse / CST / diagnostics
├── m1-lint/          # linter
├── m1-fmt/           # formatter
├── m1-typecheck/     # this crate
└── m1-lsp/           # language server; depends on the four above
```

**`m1-typecheck` depends on `m1-core` and `m1-workspace`** (git-tag deps;
`m1-core` transitively pulls in `tree-sitter-m1`), and is itself a git-tag
dependency of `m1-lsp`. (The `m1-example` example project, used by the corpus
gate, is an optional sibling checkout — see the env-var notes below.)

Because every dependency is pinned by tag, the coupling **is** visible on
GitHub — each `Cargo.toml` names its upstreams and their versions, and
Dependabot opens bump PRs as new upstream tags ship. Cutting a new upstream
release and bumping `tag = "vX.Y.Z"` in each consumer is what propagates a
change across the stack.

## The symbol model

`m1-typecheck` parses the project's MoTeC `Project.m1prj` (XML) into a flat
`SymbolTable` keyed by fully-qualified dotted path (`Root.Foo.Bar`). Each symbol
carries a `SymbolKind` (Channel, Parameter, Constant, Function, Method, Table,
Group, Reference, Other), derived from the component `Classname`. Enum data types
(`<DataTypes>`) become `EnumType`s.

### `parameters.m1cfg` — the parameter type source

The `.m1prj` names parameters but rarely says what *type* they hold. The sibling
**`parameters.m1cfg`** is where that lives: each `<Parameter><Cell Type="…"
Unit="…">` gives a parameter its concrete **value type** (`f32`→`Float`,
`u16`→`Unsigned`, `s16`→`Integer`, `bool`→`Boolean`, `enum`→a specific enum type)
and its **unit**. Loading it is what turns parameters from untyped names into
typed symbols, which is what powers:

- assignment type-mismatch checking (`T030`) against parameter targets,
- enum association of `enum`-typed cells (see below),
- richer hover/completion in the language server (type + unit).

It is **auto-discovered**: the first `*.m1cfg` found by searching the project
file's directory and its ancestors (nearest wins) is loaded automatically (the
CLI, the language server, and therefore m1-ci all do this), so a project that
ships a `parameters.m1cfg` gets type-aware checking with no extra configuration.
`--config` overrides the discovered file.

`FuncUser`/`MethodUser` components carry a `Filename`, mapping each script to its
**enclosing group** — the base for relative name resolution.

### Name resolution

A reference resolves as: local → absolute (and `Root.`-prefixed) → group-relative
(walking ancestor groups) → built-in/opaque root. Unknown and library roots are
treated as **opaque** (never flagged); an accessor on a resolved channel/parameter
or value-bearing compound (e.g. `SomeChannel.AsInteger`) is also opaque. Only a
path rooted in a known *namespace* project group whose leaf is absent is reported
unresolved — this is the false-positive guard.

### Type model

`ValueType` is `Boolean | Integer | Unsigned | Float | Enum | String | Unknown`.
`Unknown` is absorbing and silent: a rule fires only when all operands it needs
are *known*, eliminating false positives from gaps in the symbol data. Locals are
typed by Hungarian prefix (`b`/`u`/`i`/`f` + UpperCase).

## Rules

| Code | Severity | Rule |
|------|----------|------|
| T001 | Warning | **unresolved-reference** — member path whose root is a known project group does not resolve. |
| T002 | Error | **float-equality** — `==`/`!=`/`eq`/`neq` with a `Float` operand; use a tolerance check. |
| T003 | Warning | **float→integer narrowing** — a compound assignment (`+=` `-=` `*=` `/=`) storing a `Float` value back into an integral target, which truncates. Plain integer/float *widening* in arithmetic is implicit in M1 Build and not flagged. |

## v2: enum domain model, flow analysis, and the project audit

v2 builds a live **enum domain model** on top of the v1 symbol table:

- A **member index** (member name → enum type ids) is built once at load, with
  queries `enum_by_name`, `enums_with_member`, `enum_has_member`, `enum_type`.
- **Enum association**: a `.m1cfg` parameter cell `<Cell Type="enum">…</Cell>`
  back-resolves its member value to a *unique* enum type and associates the
  parameter with it (zero or many candidates → left `Unknown`, silent).
- The **typer** produces `ValueType::Enum(id)` for a typed member path
  `<EnumTypeName>.<Member>` (when the head names an enum that declares the member)
  and for any enum-associated symbol.

This unlocks four new rules, added to the default rule set
(`Registry::default()`) that `check_script` runs:

| Code | Severity | Rule |
|------|----------|------|
| T020 | Warning | **enum-non-member** — a typed member path `<EnumType>.<Member>` whose member the enum does not declare. |
| T021 | Warning | **enum-numeric-comparison** — a comparison with one *known* `Enum` operand and the other *known* numeric. |
| T004 | Warning | **signed-unsigned-comparison** — an ordering comparison (`<` `>` `<=` `>=`) mixing a known `Unsigned` operand with a known signed `Integer`, where the result can flip on wraparound. Narrow by design: ordering only, and literal operands are allowed. |
| T030 | Warning | **assignment-type-mismatch** — `target = value` where the target is a Channel/Parameter with a known type and the value's known type is incompatible. |
| T031 | Warning | **unresolved-assignment-target** — the target of a plain `=` assignment is a project-rooted path that does not resolve (e.g. `Root.Foo.Missing = 1`). Distinct from T001 because a write target is not a read; compound assignments (`+=`, …) read the target first and stay T001. |
| T040 | Warning | **channel-multiple-assignment** — a Channel assigned more than once on a single code path (control-flow aware: mutually-exclusive `if`/`else` arms are not a conflict). Implemented as a whole-tree pass in `flow.rs`, not a node-at-a-time rule. |
| T070 | Error | **when-is-exhaustive** — a `when (subject) { is (…) … }` over an enum-typed subject that does not cover every enumerator (`or` groups enumerators within one arm). One of the remaining §6 compile-time checks M1 Build enforces. An arm naming a non-member label is treated as a catch-all (the `when` is then exhaustive); a non-enum subject is skipped silently. |

Every v2 rule keeps the v1 invariant: it fires only when every type/enum it needs
is **known**, and stays silent under `Unknown` — so the m1-example corpus stays free of
spurious diagnostics.

### T050 project-name audit (opt-in)

`--audit-names` runs a project-wide symbol-name audit (`Project::audit()`),
checking each symbol's leaf name against the m1-example naming conventions: Channels and
Functions/Methods `lowerCamelCase`, Parameters/Groups and enum types
`UpperCamelCase`, Constants `CAPITALISATION` (spaces allowed). It emits **T050**
diagnostics at the project level (no source line/col). It is **off by default**:
the example project massively violates these conventions, so running it as part of
the per-script CI flow would be pure noise. The corpus gate records only a baseline
count for it.

The same audit also emits **T071 name-case-collision** (Warning, the other
remaining §6 compile-time check): (a) any two project symbols whose fully-qualified
dotted paths are equal case-insensitively but differ in actual case (reported once
per colliding pair), and (b) any project symbol whose leaf name case-insensitively
matches a firmware library object name (`Calculate`, `CanComms`, …), which it would
shadow. Both flow through `Project::audit()` / `--audit-names` alongside T050.

## CLI usage

```
m1-typecheck [--project <Project.m1prj>] [--config <parameters.m1cfg>]
             [--audit-names] <file.m1scr>...
```

```sh
m1-typecheck --project Project.m1prj --config parameters.m1cfg Scripts/*.m1scr
m1-typecheck --project Project.m1prj --audit-names
```

- `--project` defaults to the nearest `Project.m1prj` upward from the first input
  file, or `$M1_PROJECT`. With no project found, runs in project-less mode (T001
  disabled).
- `--config` defaults to the first `*.m1cfg` found by searching the project
  file's directory and its ancestors (nearest wins), or `$M1_CONFIG`; pass it
  explicitly to override. Without a cfg, parameters are untyped (`Unknown`) and
  type-dependent rules stay silent for them.
- `--audit-names` prints the project-name audit (T050 and T071) as
  `<project-path>: warning[T0xx]: <message>`; requires a loaded project.
- Output: `path:line:col: severity[T0xx]: message`. Syntax errors print first.
- Exit codes: `0` no errors, `1` ≥1 error, `2` invocation error. Most v2 rules are
  `Warning` severity; the exception is **T070** (`Error`), which — like a syntax
  error — causes a non-zero exit.

## `m1-cfg-export` — export the expected `.m1cfg` parameter list

A second binary reuses the symbol model to generate the `.m1cfg` parameter list a
project expects ([C-Nucifora/m1-tools#10](https://github.com/C-Nucifora/m1-tools/issues/10)).
Use it to seed a new calibration file, as a diff target for drift, or — with
`--missing-only` — as a CI check for parameters absent from the committed `.m1cfg`.

```
m1-cfg-export [--output <file>] [--format cfg|json|csv]
              [--baseline <existing.m1cfg>] [--missing-only] <Project.m1prj>
```

```sh
m1-cfg-export Project.m1prj                                  # full skeleton (real .m1cfg XML)
m1-cfg-export Project.m1prj --format csv -o params.csv       # every parameter as a row
m1-cfg-export Project.m1prj --missing-only --baseline parameters.m1cfg
```

- Output is the real MoTeC `.m1cfg` XML (`<Configuration><Group><Parameter><Cell
  Type=… Unit=…>`), with names *un*prefixed (`Foo.Bar`, not `Root.Foo.Bar`), or
  `json`/`csv` (which also carry the `.m1prj` `security`, not part of a `.m1cfg`).
- A parameter's cell `Type` is the exact storage type the `.m1prj` declares
  (`f32`/`u32`/`s16`/…), `enum` for any enum-typed parameter (including
  package-qualified types like `MoTeC Types.Mode Enumeration`), or the type a
  `--baseline`/auto-discovered `.m1cfg` back-resolves. Parameters with no type in
  either source (e.g. the `*.Value` of an untyped reference that isn't yet
  calibrated) are emitted with a flagged `Type=""` placeholder rather than a
  guessed type.
- `--baseline` is required by `--missing-only`; otherwise a sibling
  `parameters.m1cfg` is auto-discovered (as the type checker does) purely to
  enrich types.
- Scope: exports `BuiltIn.Parameter` components. `BuiltIn.IOResourceConstant`
  resource selections (which a real `.m1cfg` also lists) are not included yet.

## Environment variables

- `M1_PROJECT` — path to `Project.m1prj` (overrides discovery; used by the corpus
  gate).
- `M1_CONFIG` — path to `parameters.m1cfg` (overrides the sibling auto-discovery).
- `M1_CORPUS_PATH` — directory of `.m1scr` scripts for the corpus gate
  (`tests/corpus.rs`), which loads the project and checks every script without
  panicking. The gate is skipped if neither the env vars nor the sibling example
  project are present.
